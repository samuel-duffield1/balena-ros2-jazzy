# balena-ros2-jazzy

A project demonstrating containerisation of a ROS2 application, in the most basic/simplest sense, to provide a platform to develop off of for your custom Robotics application.

This project is compatible with [Balena](https://www.balena.io) for deployment of your robotics project to an edge compute device with remote fleet management.
